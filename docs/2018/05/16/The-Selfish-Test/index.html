  <p>Well, you know, there's automated testing. And then there's 'this' automated testing. And then there is 'that' automated testing. And then there is 'this-and-that' automated testing. And then there are the debates about 'this' vs 'that' vs 'this-and-that' and so on and on.</p>
<p>Except for the fact that, nobody really tells you what's in it for you. After all it is just a boatload more work. And frankly, nobody cares about work which exists just to prove (Parkinson's Law)[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parkinson's_law].</p>
<p>Which brings us to the million dollar question - Whats in it for me?  And to answer that, we will start with a simple example from a programmers day job.</p>
<h1>The Programmers Day Job. (Context setting coming up ...)</h1>
<p>The basic requirement is to be able to run a file copy operation in windows in C# under an account different from the logged in users. So we immediately raise our hands - Windows Impersonation.</p>
<p>Eh? Thats correct, but just slow down a bit, will you. Lets pile on the context a bit.</p>
<p>This file is the output file of an long operation.</p>
<p>Which accumulates data from multiple sources/APIs.</p>
<p>And does a bunch of batch processing and tansformations.</p>
<p>And accepts user intervention.</p>
<p>And redoes a bunch of calculations based on the user intervention, if any.</p>
<p>And at the end of it all creates a file in memory.</p>
<p>And reads some configuration file settings whose keys are determined by part of the in-memory file newly created.</p>
<p>And then based on that configuration data determines a remote target network folder.</p>
<p>And then switches accounts just for copying this generated file to the target remote folder.</p>
<p>Oh! And the method which copies the file over is buried deep in code as a private method which is called at the end of this entire process.</p>
<p>And no, not every line of this code-base has automated tests. (You come with with list of whys and therefores, and chances are we'll have a few in common.) The testing on this is a mix of unit, API, integration, selenium and manual testing.</p>
<p>Welcome to a programmers day job 101.</p>
