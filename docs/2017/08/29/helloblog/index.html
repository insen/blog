  <h2>Hello blog, eh, I mean, world!</h2>
<p>As far back as I can remember, I have always been writing. However, I have never blogged. Probably because I preferred the diary and the pen. Having caught a lot of flak for it from my friends, well-wishers, colleagues and bosses alike over the years, I finally decided to fix that.</p>
<p>But, I had conditions -</p>
<ul>
<li>Not much overhead beyond the writing.</li>
<li>Retain maximum possible control over content, display and offline support.</li>
<li>Also, I have a technical background so I wanted to learn something out of it.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Note :</em> The first and the third above may be self-contradictory, but I am ok with that.</p>
<p>So I started looking. Now, traditional blogging platforms end up keeping my data. I didnt like that.
Plus I havent seen good web-based blog editors. So the web based blogs weren't options I was inclined to
try first. Having encountered github blogging in the past and liked what I saw, I investigated it again.
Soon, it was clear that the simplicity of a static site was hard to beat. The catch was, Github integrates
Jekyl. Now Jekyll is good, but getting Jekyll on windows involves some fiddling and a good deal of ruby.
Having recently gone through .Net Core, Scala, Spark, Azure and NodeJs recently in quick succession, I had
no appetite for another. A little more looking, and I found <a href="http://localhost:8080/#">Pretzel</a> - a .NET
based static-site generator, plus extras.</p>
<p>Thus I settled. <em>(The living-happily-there-ever-after-question has no answers yet.)</em></p>
<ul>
<li>Blogging should be simple. Hence Github pages.</li>
<li>Blogging i.e. content, display and offline mode should remain in blogger's control. Hence pretzel and
not jekyll. Also see <a href="https://thomasfreudenberg.com/archive/2016/05/16/from-jekyll-to-pretzel/">here</a> for
more details.</li>
<li>And I get to dig into pretzel and maybe learn about static-site-generators.</li>
<li>Oh, and I rather liked the <a href="https://github.com/poole/hyde">Jekyll Hugo Theme</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Therefore, this blog is being served from a Github-pages static site, with the site template taken from
the Jekyll theme called Hyde, actually being generated by Pretzel on local machine and getting checked
into Github.</p>
<p>I just need to figure out markdown now, and then technically speaking, I am back to <strong>build, compile,
test and deploy</strong>. Blog or not, thats like coming home.</p>
