  <h1 class="post-title">Getting started with Github Pages and Pretzel</h1>
  <span class="post-date">29 Aug 2017</span>
  <p>As I mentioned in my <a href="http://insen.github.io/blog/2017/08/29/helloblog/">'hello-blog'</a> post, my search for
blogging tools ended at Github Pages and Pretzel. In this post, I will document my experience of setting up a
blog using Github pages, Pretzel, Hyde and Markdown.</p>
<h3>The Goal.</h3>
<p>The goal here is a system which has the following publish-a-blog sequence</p>
<ul>
<li>Write the blog in as close to english as possible. Using Markdown, we have close-to-english text files with extension '.md'.</li>
<li>Add the file into a specific folder</li>
<li>Review add/edited blog-site and added/edited blog-post without internet connectivity. Rinse and repeat as needed.</li>
<li>Check in all updates (aka backup). Enter Github (this step needs internet connectivity).</li>
<li>On successful check-in, online blog should be automatically updated with new content.</li>
</ul>
<h3>The Pieces.</h3>
<p>The infrastructure needed</p>
<ul>
<li>A Github project pages repository hosting
<ol>
<li>The content of the site templates, style-sheets, fonts, images and the posts in markdown files.</li>
<li>A directory within the repository named 'docs' (as per Github rules) holding the pre-assembled auto-generated and checked-in web-site. Github pages automatically serves this web-site from a public Url.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>A web-site template, which I chose to be Hyde. Why?
<ol>
<li>I liked it.</li>
<li>It is a Jekyll theme. Github pages default is Jekyll. I avoided using Jekyll because of reasons cited later, But staying close to defaults seemed a good idea.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>Pretzel to build/rebuild the web-site template, new/edited posts and generate/preview the updated web-site on local machine.</li>
<li>Git, to push the updates to the template, the posts and to the generated web-site (docs folder) into the repo and the publishable version into the docs folder. (Note that we didn't say anything about copying anything over to docs folder - Pretzel magic.)</li>
<li>Some build scripts, so that the process is seamlessly repeatable.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>(Note - If you don't have a github account, this is a good time to create one. Also, if you don't know Git, much of this blog won't make sense to you. if you really, really want to blog, this is a good option <a href="http://tumblr.com">tumblr</a>)</em></p>
<h3>Github and <a href="https://help.github.com/articles/user-organization-and-project-pages/">Github Pages</a></h3>
<p>Github Pages are a feature inbuilt into Github which enables you to host static web-sites with minimum effort. There are a few different flavors.</p>
<h4>User Pages</h4>
<p>If your github account is <strong>acc</strong>, Create a new repository named as <strong>acc</strong>, same as your Github account. A public web-site with no content is available at http://<strong>acc</strong>.github.io.</p>
<p>Add a index.html with only the text 'Hello World' into the 'master' branch.  You should see 'Hello World' in your browser from http://<strong>acc</strong>.github.io/.</p>
<h4>Organization Pages</h4>
<p>Similar to user pages except the repo is at the organization level, and has the same name as the
organization. Gets published(approximately) at http://github.com/<strong>organizationname</strong>. *Check with official Github documentation as I didn't investigate this much.</p>
<h4>Project Pages</h4>
<p>If your github account is <strong>acc</strong> a new repository named as <strong>repo</strong>, viz, your Github account is
at <strong>acc</strong>.github.com, and a public web-site with no content is available at <strong>acc</strong>.github.io/<strong>repo</strong></p>
<p>Add a folder called 'docs' in repo in the master branch.</p>
<p>Add a index.html with 'Hello World' into a 'docs' folder, 'master' branch. This automatically gets published as http://<strong>acc</strong>.github.io/<strong>repo</strong>. You should see 'Hello World' in your browser from this site.</p>
<p>These sites are available at per-repository level. They can also be configured so that the web-site is geing served either from master branch, from a top level folder in the master branch named as <strong>docs</strong> or a branch specifically named as <strong>gh-pages</strong>.</p>
<p>This is what I am using.  The <strong>docs</strong> option above.</p>
<h5>Note</h5>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Note that it is perfectly possible to have user-pages, organization-pages and project-pages in the same account. Given that the user account is <strong>acc</strong>, the organization name is <strong>organizationname</strong>, and the project repo name is <strong>repo</strong>, the following public web-sites will be available.</p>
<ul>
<li>http://<strong>acc</strong>.github.io/  as the User Page Site.</li>
<li>http://github.com/<strong>organizationname</strong> as an Organization Page Site</li>
<li>http://<strong>acc</strong>.github.io/<strong>repo</strong>  as a Project Page Site</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>The site can be a Jekyll based, <strong>OR</strong> a plain vanilla html website but with with an index.html at the top level of the site. I presume how this works is this - Github passes a http call to the site url through a web-server which can process <a href="http://liquid.org">Liquid</a> - a html templating engine. This engine passes on plain vanilla html as is, so html spec based content just flows through that web server. If using Jekyll, you need to create a Jekyll based website in the repo and branch as per your choice from the page types - user, organization or project. More details about Github's inbuilt support for Jekyll publishing can be found at <a href="https://help.github.com/articles/user-organization-and-project-pages/">here</a>.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h4>Hello Pretzel</h4>
<p>Pretzel is a open source, static-site generator in .NET.</p>
<h4>Static-site generators, and Pretzel basics.</h4>
<p>Maybe the first question to address is how many of these there are? <a href="https://www.staticgen.com/">Take a look</a>. When it comes to frameworks, We are living in a world of plenty these days.</p>
<p>What do they do? Well, basically a static site generator, especially the ones targeting blogging, take a bunch of layout templates (e.g. site-header.html, sidebar.html, footer.html), your css stylesheets, your javascript, and your posts (usually in markdown, but based on support you could probably use any syntax - markdown, yaml, plain html, razor) - and processes them to set up a plain vanilla html/css/javscript website with each post converted into a complete html page. Each page generated is a complete and self-contained html page, combining all the common layout templates, the css and javscript and the markdown content, with navigation between pages and static linking.</p>
<p>I picked Pretzel because it is written in C#. I know C# well so I can read the code, debug or enhance Pretzel if I ever so require. (Other possible options included <a href="http://wyam.io">Wyam</a>, and <a href="https:Github.com%5D">Sandra.Snow</a>.</p>
<p>Now Pretzel tries to keep as close as possible to Jekyll. Considering i am looking for a offline Jekyll replacement, Pretzel seemed appropriate.</p>
<p>And with Pretzel I can build/rebuild/run the entire site on my local machine with minimal fiddling (Which Jekyll setup, debug, or enhancement will all force me to do, and all in Ruby). As a .NET developer, my primary machine is usually all set to do just about anything with the CLR. Once testing is done, all I need to do is copy the local machine site folder into the folder from which Github serves project pages (the <strong>'docs'</strong> folder under Github repository root) and check-in to Github. Allow some time for Github to build the site and CDN propagation to happen. Your latest content should come up on your blog site.</p>
<p>For further details, check out the <a href="https://Github.com/Code52/pretzel/wiki">Pretzel wiki</a>.</p>
<h3>Setup</h3>
<h4>Gh-Pages setup in github portal</h4>
<p>Do the following to setup your Github blogging. This method sets up a Project Site as the blog site.</p>
<ul>
<li>Create a Github account, viz. <strong>acc</strong>.</li>
<li>Create a repository in github, viz. <strong>repo</strong>. I created blog-repo - https://github.com/insen/blog-repo.</li>
<li>Git Clone into local machine. This is where you will be adding your site.</li>
<li>Add a <strong>docs</strong> folder. <em>(Name needs to be exact)</em>.</li>
<li>Add an index.html with the text 'Hello world'.</li>
<li>Goto Github repository settings, Gh-Pages section - Select 'master branch/docs folder'.</li>
<li>Check <a href="#">https://<strong>acc</strong>.github.io/repo/</a> - the contents of index.html should be visible in your browser.</li>
</ul>
<p>And that's it. The blog post you are currently reading at <a href="https://insen.github.io/blog/">https://insen.github.io/blog/</a>
has been built in the same fashion, though we are still missing a few steps yet - We need to setup pretzel and
then make our site look decent. So onto Pretzel.</p>
<h4>Pretzel Setup.</h4>
<p>This is quite straight forward. Get Pretzel from <a href="https://github.com/Code52/pretzel">here</a>, <strong>OR</strong> use Chocolatey - a package manager for windows. To use Chocolatey, install Chocolatey from <a href="https://chocolatey.org/">here</a>, and on an elevated command prompt or powershell console, run the command</p>
<pre><code class="language-batch">	choco install pretzel
</code></pre>
<h3>Hyde</h3>
<p>Hyde is a pre-built theme for Jekyll. Since Pretzel closely follows Jekyll paradigms, It should work without issues, or so I thought. I was mostly correct. All we have to do here is git clone the <a href="https://github.com/poole/hyde">Hyde repository at Github</a>.</p>
<p>The reason we need this is that the basic site created by pretzel is quite horrible, both aesthetically and structurally. I started looking for something that works from an aesthetic point of view, but as close to Jekyll as possible, which led me to <a href="https://github.com/poole/hyde">Hyde</a>.</p>
<h4>Pretzel Usage</h4>
<ul>
<li>To create a basic site for you. The command (details <a href="https://Github.com/Code52/pretzel/wiki">here</a>). You can
lookup the various possible options.</li>
</ul>
<pre><code class="language-batch">	pretzel create [options]
</code></pre>
<ul>
<li>Bake the site - means generate the output website and put it into a default folder. Usually named <strong>_site</strong> and located at project root level. The command (details <a href="https://Github.com/Code52/pretzel/wiki">here</a>).</li>
</ul>
<pre><code class="language-batch">	pretzel bake 
		--source=&quot;c://srcpath&quot; 
		--destination=&quot;d://dpath&quot; 
		--cleantarget
</code></pre>
<ul>
<li>Test the site</li>
</ul>
<pre><code class="language-batch">	pretzel taste 
		--source=&quot;c://dpath&quot; 
		--port=8001
</code></pre>
<p><em>Important note</em> - the source directory in <em>'taste'</em> command is the destination directory in <em>'bake'</em> command. This is what we are using. For other options, check Pretzel wiki.</p>
<h4>Getting Gh-Pages, Pretzel and Hyde to play together.</h4>
<p>We look like we are almost done, no? well almost. I will mention the issues when I come to them. Lets get started.</p>
<h4>Steps</h4>
<ul>
<li>Ensure that your github account and blog repository are setup. refer the Github Pages setup section above for details. Clone blog repository to local machine.</li>
<li>Ensure Pretzel is on your system and working.</li>
<li>Clone Hyde to local machine from <a href="https://github.com/poole/hyde">here</a>.</li>
<li>Delete the contents of your blog repo (except docs folder), and then copy the entire contents of the hyde repo into your blog repo.</li>
<li>Run the Pretzel bake command from a prompt at the repository root folder. Pretzel should create a folder called <strong>_site</strong> under repository folder. It does not. It does this instead.</li>
</ul>
<pre><code class="language-c#">	Unhandled Exception: Pretzel.Logic.Exceptions.PageProcessingException: Failed to process E:\work\blogging\blog\_site\201
	2\02\07\example-content\index.html, see inner exception for more details ---&gt; DotLiquid.Exceptions.SyntaxException: Unknown tag 'gist'
		at DotLiquid.Block.UnknownTag(String tag, String markup, List`1 tokens)
		at DotLiquid.Block.Parse(List`1 tokens)
		at DotLiquid.Document.Initialize(String tagName, String markup, List`1 tokens)
		at DotLiquid.Template.ParseInternal(String source)
</code></pre>
<p>Why? The reason here is that a sample post in the _posts folder contains, among other bits, the following content</p>
<blockquote>
<p>{&#37; gist 5555251 gist.md &#37;}</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And this does not work in Pretzel. Why again? Because Hyde is a Jekyll theme, and Jekyll has a parser for the <strong>gist</strong> command. Pretzel does NOT. Delete this line from the post. <em>(However, this also means, you have to figure out an alternative way to embed gists in your post, if you need to)</em>.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Run <strong>bake</strong> again with no parameters. Pretzel uses the current directory as the source directory and creates the web-site. Now, <strong>bake</strong> should succeed, and you should see a sub-folder called <strong>_site</strong>. This contains your entire blog site.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Delete the <strong>CNAME</strong> file from the repository folder as well as the generated <strong>_site</strong> folder *(This causes issues   if you dont really have a domain name. An no, you CANNOT point this to the Gh-Pages Url). \</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Change <strong>index.html</strong>. This file should be in the <strong>repo</strong> directory.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>There should be a line towards the top. md <code>md{&amp;#37; for post in paginator.posts %}</code>. Change 'paginator' to 'site'. Paginator is a Jekyll plugin and doesn't work in Pretzel. No posts show up if we retain paginator.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>There should be a line a litle below the above <a href="">. Change this to <a href="">. Post navigation does not work otherwise.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Update the config.yml. My config.yml is given below. I changed the <strong>'connect'</strong> and its sub-items. These fields are used in the Liquid based html templates, viz. <span>Insen</span> or <span>https://github.com/insen</span>, etc.</p>
</li>
</ul>

<p>Please ensure that the sections marked as <em>(Setup)</em> in the above file needs to be accurately filed in. They are used to generate the site. <em>(Also for each line which begins with 'hash' is preceded by a 'slash'. the 'slash' is not part of config.yml. it was needed to escape markdown processing for this blog itself)</em>.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Run <strong>taste</strong> command as specified above from the repository directory. This command should run, open a browser on local machine and show you the sample posts (ref - we removed the 'gist' tag from one of them).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Bake and taste the site again - Check the _site and the docs folder. There should be no recursive folder patterns. <em>(IMPORTANT - this means that the bake and taste commands you used are correct with source and destination file names and other options. Otherwise your site generation times, and github check-in times will exponentially increase with the number of bakes. I added this two commands as batch files into repo the repo itself - pbake.bat and ptaste.bat. These are my build files)</em>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Copy the entire contents of the <strong>_site</strong> folder into the <strong>docs</strong> folder of the blog repository.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Check-in to Github.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Next is what?</h3>
<p>There's quite a bit left to do</p>
<ul>
<li>A better header, and landing site should show a list of posts, not posts and post-content.</li>
<li>Disqus integration.</li>
<li>Google Analytics integration.</li>
<li>Tag cloud.</li>
<li>Maybe CNAME and site search.</li>
</ul>
<p>But for now, this blog seems to be showing up on the internet. If you followed along this far with no problems, you should still be good to go.</p>
<p>Go forth, and typo. <em>(pssst !! pun intended)</em>.</p>
