Over my life I have always collected words, but over time, they keep getting lost. Now that this blog has gotten going, that's one place I have to both store and share.

All backed by Github. 

Came across the following [here](http://leptonica.com/local-sources.html)

    The road to wisdom? -- Well, it's plain
        and simple to express:
            Err
            and err
            and err again
            but less
            and less
            and less.

                --Piet Hein (Grooks)
