Over my life I have always collected words, but over time, they keep getting lost. Now that this blog has gotten going, that's one place I have to both store and share.

All backed by Github. 

Came across the following marvellous collection [here](http://leptonica.com/cachedpages/grooks/grooks.html)

A sample or two below. Click on through for more [here](http://www.archimedes-lab.org/grooks.html).

Here's one

    The road to wisdom? -- Well, it's plain
        and simple to express:
            Err
            and err
            and err again
            but less
            and less
            and less.

                --Piet Hein (Grooks)

And another 

    We must expect posterity
        to view with some asperity
        the marvels and the wonders
            we're passing on to it;
        but it should change its attitude
        to one of heartfelt gratitude
        when thinking of the blunders
            we didn't quite commit.

            --Piet Hein (Grooks)
